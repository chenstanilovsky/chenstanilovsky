SWE @ [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/)

I grew up in Brooklyn, NY and am a huge fan of blockchain and AI tech! I am always looking to learn more, curiosity drives me. I recently just graduated with a CS degree from [Hunter College](https://hunter.cuny.edu/). During that same time I was working on the future of Web3 at [Blue Studios](https://bluestudios.io/).  

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn! If you're looking for advice on finding an internship, don't be shy to message me! I have done internships at Bloomberg, and a mentorship at Microsoft.
